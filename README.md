# FoodApp - A Manifest-Powered Recipe App

This is a complete full-stack recipe sharing application built with React for the frontend and Manifest as the sole backend solution. It demonstrates how to build a data-driven application with user authentication, data relationships, and file uploads without writing any backend code.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in. Demo user is pre-configured.
- **Recipe Management**: Authenticated users can create new recipes.
- **Public Recipe Feed**: All published recipes are visible on the main dashboard.
- **Data Relationships**: Recipes are linked to their author (User) and can be assigned to Categories.
- **Image Uploads**: Recipe photos are handled by Manifest's built-in file storage.
- **Admin Panel**: A complete admin interface is automatically generated by Manifest for managing users, recipes, and categories.
- **Health Check**: The frontend includes a visual indicator for backend connectivity.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Manifest
- **Frontend**: React (Vite)
- **Data Fetching**: Manifest SDK (`@mnfst/sdk`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Heroicons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- A running Manifest backend instance

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or use the generated files).
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Manifest backend URL:
    ```
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-manifest-backend-url.vercel.app
    ```
4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend Access

- **Admin Panel**: Access the admin panel at `https://your-manifest-backend-url.vercel.app/admin`.
